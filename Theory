The data we input is done in the form of (timesteps,input_features) to the RNN
RNN is similar to ANN with 2 major differences:-
1)We do not feed the whole i/p to our RNN at once.at t=1 we i/p the first letter of the first example then get the o/p then at t=2 we i/p the second letter and so on.
2)ANN are feed forward neural network i.e info moves in the forward direction only but in RNN,there is a concept of state i.e the hidden layer sends a feedback back to 
  the i/p layers.
